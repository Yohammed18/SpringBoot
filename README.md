# README - Spring Boot Projects

## Overview

This repository contains multiple Spring Boot projects, each designed to demonstrate various aspects of modern Java development, including RESTful API calls, JPA (Java Persistence API) for database interactions, and cloud-based integration. Each project is a standalone application showcasing different functionalities and best practices in Spring Boot.

## Projects

### 1. **RESTful API Project**

- **Description**: A Spring Boot application that demonstrates how to build RESTful APIs using Spring MVC. It includes endpoints for CRUD operations and showcases best practices for designing and securing REST APIs.
- **Features**:
  - CRUD operations for managing resources
  - Custom error handling and validation
  - Integration with Swagger for API documentation

### 2. **JPA and Database Integration**

- **Description**: A Spring Boot application focusing on integrating JPA for database interactions. It showcases how to map entities to database tables, perform CRUD operations, and use repository patterns.
- **Features**:
  - Entity mapping and relationship management
  - Repository interfaces for database access
  - Transaction management and query customization

### 3. **Cloud Interaction**

- **Description**: This project demonstrates how to integrate Spring Boot applications with cloud services. It includes examples of connecting to cloud databases, message queues, and other cloud-based services.
- **Features**:
  - Configuration for cloud service integration
  - Examples of using Spring Cloud components
  - Demonstrations of cloud-specific features like auto-scaling and service discovery
